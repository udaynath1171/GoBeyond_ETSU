To bring up the frontend

Open you terminal -- 
1. Make sure you are in angular-frontend directory.
2. Run docker build -t gobeyond-frontend .
3. Once the above one is done, please run docker run -p 8080:80 gobeyond-frontend
4. You can access the website on localhost with default port 8080.

We will compose the docker once we have the backend ready for this.
